> The study of ecological networks is severaly limited by (i) the difficulty
to access data, (ii) the lack of a standardized way to link meta-data with
interactions, and (iii) the disparity of formats in which ecological networks
themselves are represented. To overcome these limitations, we conceived
a data specification for ecological networks. We implemented a database
respecting this standard, and released a R package ( `rmangal`) allowing
users to programmatically access, curate, and deposit data on ecological
interactions. In this article, we show how these tools, in conjunctions with
other frameworks for the programmatic manipulation of open ecological data,
will streamline the analysis process, and improve reproducibility in studies
of ecological networks.

# Introduction

Ecological networks enable ecologists to accommodate the complexity of natural
communities, and to discover mechanisms contributing to their persistence,
stability, resilience, and functioning. Most of the "early" studies of
ecological networks were focused on understanding how the structure of
interactions within one location affected the ecological properties of this
local community. This led to classical results, such as the buffering impact
of modularity on species loss {ref}, the increase in robustness along with
increases in connectance {ref}, and {missing}. More recently, there have been
new studies introducing the idea that different networks can be meaningfully
compared, either to understand the importance of environmental gradients
on the realisation of ecological interactions {ref}, or to understand
the mechanisms behind variation in the structure of ecological networks
{refs}. Yet, meta-analyses of a large number of ecological networks are
still extremely rare, and most of the studies comparing several networks
do so within the limit of particular systems {refs}. In part, this can be
attributed to the limited methods allowing to compare networks in which no
species are in common {ref}. However, the severe shortage of data in the
field also restricts the power of large-scale analyses. Indeed, most of
the studies working on several types of interactions focused on comparing
emerging properties {refs}.

An increasing number of approachs are being put forth to *predict* the
structure of ecological networks, either relying on latent variables {ref}
or actual traits {ref}. These approaches, so as to be adequately calibrated,
require easily accessible data. Comparing the efficiency of different methods
will also be facilitated if there is an homogeneous way of representing
ecological interactions, and the associated metadata. In this paper, we
(i) establish the need of a data specification serving as a *lingua franca*
among network ecologists, (ii) describe this data specification. Finally,
we (iii) describe `mangal`, a `R` package and compagnon database, relying
on this data specification. We provide some use cases showing how this new
approach makes complex analyzes simpler, and allows for the integration of
new tools to manipulate biodiversity resources.

# Why do we need a data specification?

Ecological networks are (often) stored as their *adjacency matrix* (or as
the quantitative link matrix), that is a series of `0` and `1` indicating,
respectively, the absence and presence of an interaction. This format is
extremely convenient for *use* (as most network analysis packages, *e.g.*
`bipartite`, `betalink`, `foodweb`, require data to be presented this way),
but is extremely inefficient at storing *meta-data*. In most cases, an
adjacency matrix will inform on the identity of species (in cases where
rows and columns headers are present), and the presence or absence of
interactions. If other data about the environment (*e.g.* where the network
wassampled) or the species (*e.g.* the population size, trait distribution,
or other observations) are available, they are most either given in other
files, or as accompanying text. In both cases, making a programmatic link
between interaction data and relevant meta-data is difficult and error-prone.

By contrast, a data specification provides a common language for network
ecologists to interact, and ensure that, regardless of their source, data
can be used in a shared workflow. Most importantly, a data specification
describes how data are *exchanged*. Each group retains the ability to store
the data in the format that is most convenient for in-house use, and only
needs to provide export options (*e.g.* through an API) respecting the
data specification. This approach ensures that *all* data can be used in
meta-analyses, and will in time increase the impact of data {ref}.

# Elements of the data specification

{complete}The data specification is built around the idea that (ecological)
networks are collections of relationships between ecological objects, each
element having particular meta-data associated. In this section, we detail
highlight the way networks are represented in the `mangal` specification. An
interactive webpage with the elements of the data specification can be
found online at `http://mangal.uqar.ca./doc/spec/`. The data specification is
implemented as a series of `JSON` schemes, *i.e.* documents describing how the
data should be formatted, and what each element represent. The schemes can be
downloaded from `https://github.com/mangal-wg/mangal-schemes/releases/tag/1.0`
{todo}. Rather than giving an exhaustive list of the data specification
(which is available online at the aforementionned URL), this section will
propose an overview of each element, and of how they interact. Within the `R`
package, information about the data format can be viewed using the `whatIs`
function (*e.g.* `whatIs(api, 'taxa')` will return a table with information
about how `taxa` objects are formated.

![An overview of the data specification, and the hierarchy between objects. Each box correspond to a level of the data specification. Grey boxes are nodes, blue boxes are interactions and networks, and green boxes are metadata. The **bold** boxes (`dataset`, `network`, `interaction`, `taxa`) are the minimal elements needed to represent a network.](figure-dataspec.pdf)

We propose `JSON` as the most efficient data format for the following
reasons. First, it has emerged as a *de facto* standard for web platform
serving data, and accepting data from users. Second, it allows *validation*
of the data: a `JSON` file can be matched against a scheme, and one can verify
that it is correctly formatted. Finally, `JSON` objects are easily and cheaply
(memory-wise) parsed in the most common programming languages, notably `R`
(equivalent to `list`) and `python` (equivalent to `dict`).

## Node informations

### Taxa




Taxa are a taxonomic entity of any level, identified by their name, vernacular
name, and their identifiers in a variety of taxonomic services. Associating
the identifiers of each taxa is important to leverage the power of the new
generation of open data tools, such as `taxize` {ref}. For example, a taxa
with an associated *NCBI Taxonomy* identifier can be represented this way:

```json
{
	"name": "Lamellodiscus ignoratus",
	"vernacular": "Lamellodiscus ignoratus",
	"ncbi": "142934"
}
```

The data specification currently accomodates `ncbi`, `gbif`, `itis` and `bold`
identifiers. Correspondances between these and other services can be made
through other tools, such as *e.g.* `taxize`. The structure of `taxa` objects
can be viewed from within the `R` package (we present an abbreviated view):


```r
whatIs(api, "taxa")[, c("field", "help", "type")]
```

```
##         field                                        help    type
## 1        bold             The BOLD identifier of the taxa integer
## 2 description             A short description of the taxa  string
## 3        gbif             The GBIF identifier of the taxa integer
## 5        itis             The ITIS identifier of the taxa integer
## 6        name             The scientific name of the taxa  string
## 7        ncbi    The NCBI Taxonomy identifier of the taxa integer
## 9  vernacular The vernacular name of the taxa, in English  string
```


### Population

A `population` is one observed instance of a `taxa` object. If your
experimental design is replicated through space, then each taxa will have a
`population` object corresponding to each locality.

### Item

An `item` is an instance of a population. Items have a `level` argument,
which can be  either `individual` or `population`; this allows to represent
both individual-level networks (*i.e.* there are as many `item`s attached to
a `population` than there were individuals of this `population` sampled),
and population-level networks. When `item` represents a population, it is
possible to give a measure of the size of this population.

The notion of `item` is particularly useful for time-replicated designs:
each observation of a population at a time-point is an `item` with associated
trait values, and possibly population size.

# Use cases

{edit}In this section, we present use cases using the `rmangal` package for
`R`, to interact with a database implementing this data specification, and
serving data through a `REST`ful API (`http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/`). It
is possible for users to deposit data into this database, through the `R`
package. Data are made available under a *CC-0 Waiver*.


```r
library(rmangal)
api <- mangalapi()
```


## Plotting a network


```r
graph <- network_as_graph(api, 2)
plot(graph, layout = layout.circle)
```
